# VBA-Macro-Company-report

This is a project that automated a slow manual process for my team. All possibly sensitive data have been anonymised.

Used tools: VBA coded macros in MS Excel.

**How to navigate the project:**
1. Open the *Macro_Report_for_the_vendor* file to see what the different macros do with the *Big report*.
   You can also see the VBA code in the Developer tab -> Visual Basic.
2. Click on the different macros' buttons to see them make changes in the *Big report*.

**Files:**
- *Macro_Report_for_the_vendor* - the main macros file
- *Big report* - a report generated from company's system
- *Vendor report template* - a report's template that defines the format of the data to be sent to the vendor (Note: This file is only illustrative. The previous two files are the main ones in this project.)
